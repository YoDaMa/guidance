# GUIDANCE
### This is an effort to consolidate information I consider to be useful for coding. 
Others are welcome to contribute to this repository of information and even offer suggestions on restructuring. I aim to continously add to this for my own benefit information that I tend to google a lot or little cool tidbits I found in the corner of the internet and I don't want to lose. 

This is really a personal project to maintain a central location of information for reference, but I'm sharing it openly in the event that others find my labors useful.
